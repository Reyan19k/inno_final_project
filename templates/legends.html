            Mirage is the kind of guy who likes to stand out. The youngest of four brothers, he perfected the art of
            fooling around to get attention. The one thing he took seriously was Holo-Pilot technology: introduced to
            the illusion-creating tech by his engineer mother, he poured over the mechanisms and learned all he could
            about them. Even when his brothers went MIA during the Frontier War, Mirage and his mother continued to
            develop holo devices, and the work brought them closer.
            While working as a bartender to make ends meet, Mirage heard amazing stories from his patrons about the Apex
            Games and the wealth and glory that came with victory. As good as both of those sounded, he knew he couldn't
            risk leaving his mother childless - until she gave him a set of customized holo devices and told him to
            follow his dream. Mirage is now the life of the Apex Games, outwitting opponents and charming audiences
            across the Outlands.</p>

            the fabric of reality — but those abilities came at a price. Years ago, she woke up in an IMC detention
            facility with no memory of who she was. Senior Science Pilot Renee Blasey, who volunteered as guinea pig for
            her own experiments... whose partner betrayed her and locked her away… no longer existed. All that was left
            was a timid girl, frightened by a cacophony of voices in her head, until another version of herself appeared
            and taught her to listen to the voices. Following her lead, Wraith found the strength to break free from her
            prison and escape into a different reality - this reality.</p>

            Almost a century ago, the Outlands were dangling on the edge of a cataclysmic energy crisis. Dr. Mary
            Somers, a charmingly eccentric astrophysicist, was hired to find a solution. Mary moved her family to the
            scientific research station on Olympus and set to work.
            With the help of her apprentice, Dr. Reid, Mary discovered Branthium - an element she was convinced could be
            the key to limitless energy. But Branthium can be found only on the accretion disk of a black hole, so Mary
            and Dr. Reid departed on a dangerous mission to prove her theory right.
            Mary promised her son Newton she'd return safe and sound. But Dr. Reid betrayed her, stealing the Branthium
            and sending her shuttle into the black hole's orbit. Using her wits, Mary modified her robotic vacuum
            companion N.E.W.T. to escape. But time moves differently on the outskirts of a black hole, and she was 87
            years too late.
            Now Mary is determined to fund her research to find a way to go back in time and be with her son. She joins
            the Apex Games as Horizon, master of gravity, just in time for the next season to debut on Olympus--where
            her old life once was and where she had promised to return.</p>

            subjects.
            As he toiled in secret, Nox began to see the beauty in his creations and their ability to destroy anything

            volunteers, he has always been skilled at getting others out of dangerous situations that are common in the
            Outlands. However, he only began to understand the value of protecting others when he and his boyfriend
            stole his father's motorcycle, took it on a joyride, and got trapped by a deadly mudslide. His parents saved
            them, and his father lost an arm in the process. Gibraltar has never forgotten that sacrifice and has
            devoted his life to helping those in need.
            The Apex Games didn't change that, but they changed what it meant. Many of Gibraltar's friends and
            colleagues have competed in the Games for extra money, fame, and glory over the years, and some never came
            home. Gibraltar joined to keep them safe and, for the first time, his skills as a rescuer and his rebellious

            Pathfinder is the picture of optimism, despite his circumstances. A MRVN (Mobile Robotic Versatile eNtity)

            Pathfinder eventually set off in search of his creator.
            Pathfinder has learned much in his travels since then (like how to make a mean Eastern Leviathan Stew) but
            hasn't come any closer to finding his creator. Still, he's never given up hope, and has joined the Apex
            Games to gain a following--and hopefully draw the attention of his maker. In the meantime, he remains
            enthusiastic and helpful, always ready to make new friends (then shoot them).
